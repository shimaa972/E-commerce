# 📊 E-commerce Project: Data Cleaning and Validation

## 🗓 Date
May 23, 2025

## 🧾 Executive Summary

This project focuses on the **data cleaning**, **validation**, and **analysis** processes for migrating an E-commerce database to **Microsoft Azure Cloud**. The goal is to enhance data quality and improve **reporting accuracy** and **business intelligence** using tools like **Power BI** and **TPOT** for customer segmentation.

---

## 📁 Project Objectives

- Ensure scalable and secure data storage using **Azure**.
- Enable advanced reporting and dashboards via **Power BI**.
- Perform customer segmentation using **machine learning (TPOT)**.
- Clean and validate existing data for reliability.

---

## 🧹 1. Data Cleaning

### 1.1 Initial Inspection

- **Missing values**:
  - Categories table: 5 `NULL`s in `parent_id`.
- **Discounts table issues**:
  - Missing foreign keys (`product_id`, `category_id`, `order_id`).
  
### 1.2 Action Taken

- Excluded discounts from analysis due to poor data integrity.
- Marked affected rows for future remediation.

---

## 📈 2. Key Insights

### 2.1 Customer Segmentation (via TPOT)

Three primary customer personas identified:

- **Seekers**: Browse a lot, use wishlists, but do not purchase.
- **Quick Buyers**: Visit and purchase with minimal delay.
- **Hesitant**: Long session durations without conversion.

### 2.2 Returns Analysis

- Some **returned products received positive reviews**, suggesting issues like:
  - Poor fit or unmet expectations.
- **Fake reviews** identified from users with no purchase history.

---

## 💡 3. Recommendations

1. **Enforce foreign key constraints** in the discounts table to ensure data integrity.
2. **Collect demographic data** (e.g., age, gender) to improve segmentation.
3. **Target customers who return positively-reviewed products** for potential retention.
4. **Implement detection for fake reviews**, possibly via machine learning classifiers.
5. **Add `delivery_date` and `stock_in_date` fields** to enhance logistics and sales forecasting.
